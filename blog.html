	<li><a href="http://thinksimplenow.com/" target="_blank">Think Simple Now!</a>
		Tina Su has created a masterpiece and for the past couple years it’s been her full time gig. She has been one of my main models for success. Her articles cover everything from speed reading to meditation to simple living and creativity. Every post is super high quality with ways to make a change. Real life issues with simple solutions.<br><br>
	  One of my all time favorite posts:<a href="http://thinksimplenow.com/relationships/how-to-keep-a-relationship/" target="_blank">How to Keep a Relationship</a>
	</li><br>
	<li><a href="https://zenhabits.net/" target="_blank">Zen Habits.</a>This is one of my foundation sites. Leo Babauta is all about simplicity, productivity and simply enjoying life. His posts are so easy to apply and see immediate benefit. He just made the number one slot for Time Magazine Best Blogs of 2010. In four years he’s grown to over 200,000 subscribers from a total standing start. He also provides awesome resources through the A-List Blogger Club for those looking to make their website, writing and blog a career. The stuff works. What a generous person.<br><br>

	<li><a href="https://tim.blog/" target="_blank">The Blog of Tim Ferriss:</a> Experiments in Lifestyle Design. Tim’s book, The 4-Hour Work Week has had a more profound effect on my life and belief of what’s possible than any other single resource. Of the past 9 people I’ve given the book to, 7 have quit their job within months, to go on to do things more in line with who they are. His blog is an extension to his book including all kinds of life hacking and lifestyle designs experiments. Tim is a brilliant guy and has done wonders for getting us to turn our thinking on its head and be better because of it.<br><br>
	Here’s a fun post of his to get you started:<a href="https://tim.blog/2009/03/03/how-to-be-jason-bourne-multiple-passports-swiss-banking-and-crossing-borders/" target="_blank">How to Be Jason Bourne.</a> 
	</li><br>
	<li><a href="http://www.illuminatedmind.net/" target="_blank">Illuminated Mind:</a>Follow Your Dreams. Jonathan Mead will also turn your thinking upside down, in a good way. He’s only in his mid 20’s and has made this site his career. He writes killer articles about finding and living your passion and doing your best to add value to the world. I read his 0-Hour Work Week eBook last weekend, after which I could hardly sleep. The simple premise: If you do what you truly love and are meant to do, then it’s no longer work. It all becomes enjoyment. Very contrarian thinker.<br><br>
	</li><br>
	 
     <li><a href="https://chrisguillebeau.com/" target="_blank">The Art of Non Conformity.</a>  Chirs Guillebeau, not unlike Tim or Jonathan, is all about challenging authority and seeing the world. His blog documents his goal to see all 192 countries (At about 30 years old, he’s already hit 125) and to share his life lessons throughout the journey. What a way to combine work and passion. I just read his Manifesto, A Brief Guide to World Domination, and it no doubt would have made me quit my job if I hadn’t already. Very life purpose oriented. His view is if you do what you love, you can take over of the world (or do just about anything else on your mind). I think he might be doing both.<br><br>

    Here’s something to make you want to leave the country for a bit:<a href="https://chrisguillebeau.com/beginners-guide-to-travel-hacking/" target="_blank">Beginner’s Guide to Travel Hacking.</a>

    <li><a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/" target="_blank">Get More from Life.</a> I cannot believe what Scott Young has accomplished in his 21 years. His blog covers him financially and he hasn’t even finished university. He’s written a few books and his articles make you want to explore the world and refuse to settle. He is on a quest to learn how to get the most from life and so far he’s on an awesome track.<br><br>

    My favorite recent post:<a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2010/07/05/is-being-rich-important/">Is Being Rich Important to Living the Ideal Life?</a>So right on!
   </li><br>

   <li><a href="https://www.arvinddevalia.com/blog/" target="_blank">Make It Happen.</a> Arvind Devalia is a burst of energy. Each of his articles put us one step closer to living the life we deserve. This is his way of making the world at least a bit better. With it comes practical steps and a ton of exercises to actually get us where we want to be. His eBook, Get the Life You Love, does a stellar job of walking you through 25 areas of your life with exercises and actions to make it happen. Arvind is incredibly generous and his experience as a coach and writer really shine through. I am a better writer and contributor because of it.<br><br>

   Arvind’s most recent post<a href="https://www.arvinddevalia.com/blog/2010/07/09/why-you-are-enough/" target="_blank">Why You Are Enough</a> is amazing.

  <li><a href="http://goodlifezen.com/">Good Life Zen.</a> Mary Jaksch runs this site as well as WriteToDone and A-List Blogger Club with Leo from Zen Habits. I love this for simple refreshers regarding meditation, clarity and just being a little bit better at things. She’s an authorized Zen Master and offers a unique experience through her Virtual Zen Retreats. Mary is an inspiration for anyone looking to make a career of blogging and she will enable you to do so in awesome ways. Here genuine generosity and interest in helping people along their paths is something the world could use a little more of.<br><br>

  Here’s a nice post to slow you down:<a href="http://goodlifezen.com/2008/04/18/how-to-start-meditating-ten-important-tips/" target="_blank">How to Meditate: 10 Important Tips.</a>

<li><a href="https://liveboldandbloom.com/" target="_blank">Live Bold and Bloom.</a> Barrie Davenport is a Career and Life Transition Coach turning pro blogger. It’s been invigorating to see her grow. She covers everything from health and energy to career and purpose. I also love checking out her book recommendations. Her free eBook How to Lead a Meaningful Life is a fun shot in arm for being more purposeful with how you spend your time. No doubt she loves exactly what she’s doing with hers.<br><br>

This post made me think:<a href="https://liveboldandbloom.com/" target="_blank">How your Language Can Change your Life.</a>

<li><a href="http://penvspaper.com/" target="_blank">The Art of Great Things.</a> Jeffrey Tang is an amazing writer and in his mid 20’s he’s an inspiration to see the following he’s created. He shares his quest for discovering the great things that make our lives rich (and not necessarily just our bank accounts). He’s written some awesome articles for Zen Habits and has made an impressive mark for himself thus far. I can only imagine what’s next.<br><br>

<li><a href="https://www.stevenaitchison.co.uk/blog-now-a-google-pagerank-5-2/" target="_blank">Change Your Thoughts.Change Your Life.</a> Steve Aitchison’s site is full of fresh thoughts and some really powerful free eBooks. As a coach and NLP expert his site is dedicated to changing thoughts, patterns and beliefs that keep us from living the life we deserve. A lot of hands-on tips and processes along with some unique guided meditations. Awesome to see all he’s done.<br><br>

I loved his recent post/video:<a href="https://www.stevenaitchison.co.uk/blog-now-a-google-pagerank-5-2/" target="_blank">The Space Between Something and Nothing.</a>
